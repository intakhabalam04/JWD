// The given recurrence relation is \(T(n) = 16T(n/4) + n^2 \log n\). We can use the Master Theorem to determine its time complexity. The Master Theorem has the following form:

// \[ T(n) = aT\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) + f(n) \]

// In the given relation:

// - \(a = 16\)
// - \(b = 4\)
// - \(f(n) = n^2 \log n\)

// Now, let's compare \(f(n)\) with \(n^{\log_b a}\):

// - \(n^{\log_b a} = n^{\log_4 16} = n^2\)

// We can classify \(f(n)\) into three cases:

// 1. If \(f(n)\) is \(O(n^{\log_b a - \epsilon})\) for some \(\epsilon > 0\), then the time complexity is \(T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a})\).
// 2. If \(f(n)\) is \(\Theta(n^{\log_b a})\), then the time complexity is \(T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a} \log n)\).
// 3. If \(f(n)\) is \(\Omega(n^{\log_b a + \epsilon})\) for some \(\epsilon > 0\), and if \(a f(n/b) \leq k f(n)\) for some constant \(k < 1\) and sufficiently large \(n\), then the time complexity is \(T(n) = \Theta(f(n))\).

// In our case, \(f(n) = n^2 \log n\) and \(n^{\log_b a} = n^2\).

// Since \(f(n)\) is not of the form \(O(n^{\log_b a - \epsilon})\) or \(\Omega(n^{\log_b a + \epsilon})\), we fall into the second case.

// Therefore, the time complexity of the given recurrence relation is \(T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a} \log n) = \Theta(n^2 \log n)\).
